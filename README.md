# SDL3 GPU Experiments & 3D Renderer Prototype

This repository contains experiments and example projects built with **SDL3** using its **GPU API**. The primary goal is to explore and demonstrate the functionalities offered by SDL3’s GPU capabilities, including advanced rendering techniques, texture management, shaders, and more.

This project serves as a playground for testing ideas and building a foundation for a **3D renderer**, showcasing how SDL3 can be leveraged for high-performance graphics applications.

## Key Features & Goals
- Hands-on experiments with **SDL3 GPU API**.
- Demonstrations of **rendering techniques**, including 2D and 3D concepts.
- Implementation of basic **shader effects** and texture workflows.
- Modular examples serving as building blocks for a **future 3D renderer**.
- Educational resource for learning GPU programming with SDL3.

This repository is ideal for developers interested in graphics programming, game engine experimentation, or exploring SDL3’s GPU capabilities in a practical context.
